self-intro:
I’m a full-stack engineer with expertise in distributed systems and a passion for AI-driven, data-powered solutions. I love exploring system design, business logic, and data flows to uncover new ways technology can optimize performance and efficiency at scale.


Education: B.S. Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley. Fall 2015 - Fall 2019

Experience:
Microsoft – Software Engineer (Mar 2022 – Feb 2025, Mountain View, CA)
At Microsoft, I helped shape the future of productivity by building APIs and infrastructure for Copilot and Teams. I worked on large-scale systems that needed to be both fast and reliable, raising critical API reliability to 99.97%. I led vendor teams to fully automate testing pipelines, which boosted code quality and developer velocity. On top of development, I carried global on-call responsibilities—solving high-priority incidents for Fortune 500 customers across eight regions. These experiences honed my ability to design for scale, resilience, and user trust.

Michaels – Software Engineer (Oct 2020 – Mar 2022, San Jose, CA)
I was part of Michaels’ transformation from a legacy e-commerce system to a modern, scalable platform. On the backend, I built authentication flows, in-app messaging, and secure user management with JWT and Spring Boot. On the frontend, I brought the new platform to life by creating interactive dashboards and management tools in React and Redux. This role gave me end-to-end ownership across the stack, from designing APIs to delivering user-facing features.

Qcompass Voyage Limited (Qeeq.com) – Software Engineer (Jan 2018 – Aug 2019, Hong Kong)
At this fast-growing car rental startup operating in 160+ countries, I wore multiple hats as both a full-stack engineer and data analyst. I built analytics dashboards used daily by 200+ employees across product, marketing, and finance teams, enabling smarter pricing and operational strategies. I also optimized large-scale data pipelines to handle millions of data points efficiently. This early experience taught me how to merge engineering with data insights to drive business growth.

project:

Macros Agent(2024)
Developed an AI-driven workflow automation system that converts natural-language descriptions into Dynamics 365 macros(workflows) using Azure openAI and Semantic Kernel. Integrated Dynamics API and best practices to ensure compliant workflows, reducing creation time by 80% and accelerating customer’s migration from Unified Service Desk to SaaS.

AI-powered Agent Diagnostic Tool (2023)
Built an AI-powered self-service diagnostics copilot in Dynamics 365 that interprets natural-language issue descriptions with LLMs and automatically executes diagnostic workflows (App Profile, Presence, Live Chat). Combined workflow outputs with RAG over internal troubleshooting guides to identify root causes and generate contextual resolution recommendations. Reduced support ticket volume by 60% and resolution time by 45% through LLM troubleshooting and automated reporting.

In-App Messaging for Marketplaces (2021)
To improve buyer-seller communication, I designed an in-app messaging service with text, image sharing, push notifications, and even broadcast messaging capabilities. By integrating with Twilio’s APIs, the system increased engagement and kept conversations flowing across devices.

Identity & Access Management (2020)
I developed a complete role-based access control (RBAC) system with APIs for managing users, roles, and permissions. The system included detailed activity logs, multithreaded processing for scale, and email notifications for security alerts—ensuring enterprises could manage identity securely and reliably.
